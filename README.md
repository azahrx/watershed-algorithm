Watershed transform is a method for image segmentation. There are many watershed transform immersion algorithm, one of the algorithm used is Dijkstra-Moore's shortest path algorithm to calculate topographical distance based on image integration. 

Dijkstra-Moore's shortest path algorithm where example graph G consist of five node A, B, C, D, E. From one node to another, there is a shortest path.

Usage: input node in dijkstra()

How the code works:
1. Create starting graph as a format
2. Define function dijkstra with parameter graph, start, goal
3. Create first loop for the node
4. Second loop where node is less than min node
5. Get pop for result
6. Create break where path cannot be reached
