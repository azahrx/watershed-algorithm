Watershed transform is a method for image segmentation. One of the algorithm used is Dijkstra-Moore's shortest path algorithm
to calculate topographical distance based on image integration.

How it works:
1. Create starting graph as a format
2. Define function dijkstra with parameter graph, start, goal
3. Create first loop for the node
4. Second loop where node is less than min node
5. For result use pop
6. Create break where path cannot be reached
